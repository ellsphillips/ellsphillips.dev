My first blog post - a lot has happened to reach this point. Let me explain...

## A bit about me

I'm Elliott, a Software Engineer from the South Wales' valleys. Graduated from the University of Exeter with a Mathematics degree, loved it&mdash;all of it, minus the statistics&mdash;where I found real joy in problem solving with logic, patterns, and proof.

Throughout my lectures and coursework, I used MATLAB and LaTeX. Classic science undergrad tools, right? LaTeX (and its derivatives) is awesome though, and is still my go-to for typesetting documents and presentations.

I wasn't sure where I was headed, but I knew I wanted to work in some sort of scientific or technical field.

## My career, in a nutshell

I joined the Civil Service as an Operational Researcher, where I was able to apply mathematics to real-world problems, before diving into the world of Data Science. Shout out to my fantastic mentors and teams along the way.

I built several ML models to classify large unstructured data into new Government assets, and even worked with a large banking firm to generate insights from transactional data throughout the pandemic.

Then I finally got around to dedicating time to web development. Learned to render `Hello, World!` to the screen, centered a div, and quickly moved onto React. It was here I found what I wanted to do. The thrill of visualising your work first-hard and able to communicate messages through creative design is <em>awesome</em>.

A few years later, I now lead several development teams at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, developing Government's spatial data capability by building applications to inform policy with user-centred design and novel data sources.

## Why now?

Good question. Not sure, but I know I've wanted to do this for quite some time.

I love learning new technologies, growing with people and teams, and more generally just sharing my experiences and knowledge with others. I hope to use this blog to do just that.
